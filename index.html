                            <p>Do dogs recognize their name each time that we call them? 
                                Yes, they are actually capable of that. 
                                Dogs are actually capable of discerning their own name from command words or any string of words. 
                                Though this is not something that they will simply learn as they grow up, 
                                they will have to be trained by regularly calling them by their name appropriately.</p>

                            <h4>There are several reasons for dogs to show aggression towards their owners.</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <h4>Illness or injury</h4>
                                    <p>Dogs often act aggressive when they feel pain or discomfort in their body. Make sure to take your dog to a veterinarian by any means if you feel like this is the reason before it gets worse for anybody.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <h4>Fear</h4>
                                    <p>Not every dog has lived a life full of treats and flowers, dogs can also experience traumatic experiences as it grows up. Depending on the background of your dog, make sure to treat them gently and with love. To avoid harm for everyone, make sure to approach dogs with full care.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <h4>Possessiveness</h4>
                                    <p>Possessiveness can occur with any object. If a dog is holding an object and is not letting anyone else touch it, it is best that you simply let them have it until they get tired of it. If it is an object that you really have to take away, make sure to approach the dog carefully and even use other distractions to get the object.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <h4>Frustration</h4>
                                    <p>Remember that dogs also value their personal space a lot. Continues violation of their space might cause the dog the feel frustrated and act aggressive.</p>

                            <h3>How To Throw A Birthday Party For Your Dog</h3>
                            <p>There are many factors of shouting a birthday party for one's pet but what you should consider first 
                                and foremost is the comfort of your pet.</p>

                                <p>The location of the party could be anywhere. If the weather is good and you'd prefer outdoors, 
                                you could go to a dog park or a beach or even just your yard if spacious enough.</p>

                                <p>Who you should to the party invite depends on your dog. 
                                Your family and friends are a given but they could also just be anyone that owns a dog that your dog 
                                can bond with. In the end of the day, it depends on the personality of your dog whether they're 
                                comfortable with many other people or if they prefer a private space.</p>

                                <p>The party itself could just be a very casual one. 
                                Make sure to plan out activities that the dogs of the party could enjoy. 
                                Prepare a lot of treats to keep them engaged in the event.</p>

                                <p>For the food for humans, it could just be the usual ones like hotdogs, pastas and more. 
                                Just take caution that if youâ€™re preparing any food that could cause harm to any dogs, 
                                make sure that you place the food to be out of reach for them.</p>
                                
                                <p>For the dogs, prepare food that are specifically for dogs, 
                                make sure that they are all prepared with smaller amount of spices. 
                                You should prepare a lot of treats for every canine guest and lastly a dog-themed birthday cake 
                                for your dog to eat.</p>
